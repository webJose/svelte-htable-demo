<p>
	A basic table with hierarchical data that represents employees grouped by manager.  The table has only basic styling using a single CSS class.
</p>
<p>
	In this example, only the required <code>columns</code> and <code>items</code> props are being used, so the expansible items show the ID as the summary, there's no level or path shown and the data items are being grouped and expansibles are being placed first.
</p>
<p>
	Open the code file and try setting the <code>grouping</code> prop to <code>ItemGrouping.Undefined</code> or <code>ItemGrouping.ExpansiblesLast</code>.
</p>
